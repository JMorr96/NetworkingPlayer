# Synchroviewer

This player is a networking project written in C# using windows forms to demonstrate the Socket class in C#. The purpose of the project is connecting two video player clients with chat functionality and watching the same file in sync with the other player client.

Although the initial scope of the project is rather small, I believe there is ample opportunity for it to grow.
